                    <span>Patrick Brien</span> is a designer currently working for <a href= "loveandmoney.agency"> Love + Money.</a> He spends most of his time working on 1 x graphic designs but does also do other shit. Although he likes simple, minimal typography he understands that a website can not only be a paragraph and so he is working to change this. In the meantime you can contact him at <a href="hello@patrickbrien.com.au">hello@patrickbrien.com.au</a> or check out some of his work <a href="https://www.instagram.com/patrickbrien/">@patrickbrien.</a>
